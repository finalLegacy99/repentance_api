So much strife and discord brought about by Chadul that she had to relinquish her own life to quell, while Deoch stood idly by while his fathers madness corrupted the world. But now his eyes are open, now that his love is gone, because of his inaction.

I want to at the very least have the chance to climb the ranks of this society.” Srgious hangs his head down. “But there is no redemption, there is no recourse, the only option seems to be to end this life and start another.” The cleric reveals a small dirk from his hand and contemplates it.",

Failing this will grant you their ire, succeeding will grant you their favor. Take that judgment to your kingdom’s figurehead, and from there the will of the mundanes shall answer you.” As Deoch speaks these last words so too does the flames around him dissipate into the past, soon followed by his avatar.
